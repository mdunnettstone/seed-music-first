Thanks for registering your interest in a Seed Music practice room at <%= @company.humanize %>. A music room in your office is one step closer.

The next and final step is to share.

We want our practice rooms to have the biggest possible impact, which means installing them in offices where there are the most musicians (aspiring, former or current).

Please spread the word among your colleagues, friends and fellow musicians. The link is here <%= yes_url %>, and there's a suggested email to send round below.

The more people you send this to, the more likely you are to get a place to play music in your office. Check the leaderboard (<%= leaderboard_url %>) in the coming days to see how <%= @company.humanize %> is doing.

Very best wishes,
Seed Music

Hi all,

Seed Music is converting under-utilised office space into fantastic music practice rooms.

To make sure the rooms have the biggest impact, Seed Music is ranking the most musical offices. Those at the top of the leaderboard have the highest chance of getting one. I think <%= @company.humanize %> should be up there.

So please vote for <%= @company.humanize %> here: <%= yes_url %>. It just takes your email and they don't share your information with anyone.

Best wishes,
